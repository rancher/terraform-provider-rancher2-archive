# Rancher2 Provider

The Rancher2 provider is used to interact with the
resources supported by Rancher v2. The provider needs to be configured
with the URL of the Rancher server at minimum and API credentials if
access control is enabled on the server.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the Rancher2 provider
provider "rancher2" {
  api_url    = "https://rancher.my-domain.com"
  access_key = "${var.rancher2_access_key}"
  secret_key = "${var.rancher2_secret_key}"
}
```

* `api_url` - (Required) Rancher API url. It must be provided, but it can also be sourced from the `RANCHER_URL` environment variable.
